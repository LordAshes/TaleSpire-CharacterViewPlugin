R2ModMan configuration for the offers the following settings:

Default Tilt Value = Indicates the default head tilt value when Character View is used.
Reset Head = Indicates if the tilt should be reset to the default and the swivel set to 0 when the view returns to normal view.
Use Post Processing = Indicates if post processing is used during Character View.
